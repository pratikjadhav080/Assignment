    "a memory location is created with the variable name and the value assigned to the variable in stored inside that location.\n",

    "There are many data types in python. Few of them are given below:\n",
    "    \n",
    "A.\tText Type: str. \n",
    "\n",
    "Str: String is one of the data-types in Python.  They are sequences of characters, represented as ‘str’ and enclosed either in single quotes or double quotes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Representation in Python: “iNeuron” or ‘iNeuron’ \n",
    "\n",
    "B.\tNumeric Types: int, float, complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tInt: int is basically a numerical data-type in python. It takes an integer as a value. Integer is a whole number – negative or positive.  Integers = {..., −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, ...} There is No decimal point in integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Representation in Python: x = 2. Here 2 is an int type value assigned to x variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tFloat: float is one of the numerical data-types in python. It takes a real number as a value. Real numbers are combination of whole numbers and fractions, which means it also includes decimal point.\n",
    "Example of float: 1.2, 3.0, -99.3 etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tComplex: complex is another numerical data-type in python. It is represented as (x + yj) where x and y are floats and “j” is square root of -1 which is an imaginary number. Here, x is a real part of the number and y is an imaginary of the complex number.\n",
    "Example of complex number: 2+3j \n",
    "\n",
    "C.\tSequence Types: list, tuple, range.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tList: List contains different data types like int, float, string, complex numbers within two square brackets. We can also have a list within a list, which is known as a nested list. We can also have list of tuples and many more combinations.List is mutable. However, tuple elements inside the list are immutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex: L = [1, 2.0, 3+4j,'ineuron', [1,2,3,4], ['wew','edad','dff'], (1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)]\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tTuple: Like a List, Tuple is also used to store multiple elements inside it. However, elements inside a tuple are represented inside within round brackets. Unlike list, elements inside a tuple are immutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex. T = (1, 2, (3+4j), 'Pratik', 'ineuron', [1, 2, 3, 4])\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tRange: range is a function which helps in returning data in sequence starting from 0th index to end index with an increment of 1, excluding end index.  syntax of range is range(start, stop, step)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, start means starting index, stop means end index, step indicates increment\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex. range (0,10,1) \n",
    "\n",
    "It can also be represented as range (0, 10) where default step size is one.\n",
    "\n",
    "D.\tBoolean Type: Bool: There are two types of Boolean type in python  1.True, 2. False. It indicates whether the operation \n",
    "is true or false.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: lets check whether a is equal to b or not.\n",
    "    \n",
    "a = 10, b = 20\n",
    "print (a == b)\n",
    "output: False\n",
    "    \n",
    "since a is not equal to b, we get output as False. If a and b has equal values, it wud have returned True Boolean."
